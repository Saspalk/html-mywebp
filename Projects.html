            During my PhD at DUTH I was involved in the FLAWLESS project, for the purpose of which computer vision algorithms were developed to improve the production line performance of two large dairy companies in Greece. In this context, I was involved with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for the extraction of LOT number from yoghurt packages in real time, and also with the use of Siamese neural networks for the detection of defective yoghurt cups. These were a part of the overall implementation which was carried out by a set of partners and united in a common API.

            Working as a research assistant at CERTH, I was involved in the European Perivallon project. Within which my main focus was the detection of organised contamination in aquatic environments using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In the first instance the lack of a publicly available benchmark dataset led me to create this so that our subsequent experiments could be applied there. During the evaluation of this I used state of the art neural networks for semantic image segmentation such as DeepLab V3+ etc. For more information about the project click <a href="https://perivallon-he.eu/">here</a>:
